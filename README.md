# Vinoth Rajamanickam - Portfolio
## About
Hello, I,m Vinoth, and I have a strong background in data analysis, with a degree in Computer Science. Over the past year, I have worked on multiple data analysis projects, both in freelancing and in intern.

I’m highly skilled in SQL, Excel, and Python, and I’ve used these tools extensively to clean, process, and analyze large datasets. I also have experience with data visualization tools like Tableau and Power BI, which I use to create reports and dashboards that communicate insights effectively.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
